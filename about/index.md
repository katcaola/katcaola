## Backstory for the Blog Name

Way back when I was a youngin' in highschool, I went to see _Wall-e_ in theaters. When the credits began rolling, I read off some of the names and positions. I was watching with my partner at the time and we would have contests to see how many names we could find that were similar to names of people we knew. One of the sections I read out loud as "The Invéntory" and commented, "Wow that's so cool! I bet that's where they come up with all sorts of cool and novel ideas and implementations" and my partner turned to me and said "Kat, that's _Inventory_" and we proceeded to laugh about it. I never was good at pronouncing things...
