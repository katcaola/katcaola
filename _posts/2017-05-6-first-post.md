# Hello World!

This is the first post of my first ever blog. I'm not really sure what to say on a first post so I'll jump into what I _think_ should be in this blog.

## Backstory for the blog name
Way back when I was a youngin' in highschool, I went to see _Wall-e_ in theaters. When the credits began rolling, I read off some of the names and positions. I was watching with my partner at the time and we would have contests to see how many names we could find that were similar to names of people we knew. One of the sections I read out loud as "The Invéntory" and commented, "Wow that's so cool! I bet that's where they come up with all sorts of cool and novel ideas and implementations" and my partner turned to me and said "Kat, that's _Inventory_" and we proceeded to laugh about it. I never was good at pronouncing things...

## First Post Ever Whoo!
I come up with ideas left and right, and taking a page from [Paul Arden](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/62/6b/5a/626b5a2fc5857ae0fe704f2de905f5f2.jpg) I figured a good way to get them implemented (or inspire others to implement them if they so choose) is by sharing them with others. I have a lot of ideas, hobbies, and interests that I really want to share. Here is a _(not all encompassing by any means)_ list of all the things I will more than likely write about. This way if people stumble upon  this blog, they will know whether to stick around... or maybe they will read the tags. 

- Programming and code stuff
- Japan, Anime, Japanese
- Ideas that my brain came up with all by itself
- Miniature cooking items
- Miniature and/or Japanese food
- Moogles. Definitely moogles. 
- Crafts of all kinds:
    - Chain mail
    - Paper Craft
    - Perler Beads
    - Upcycled materials
- There will be Puns. Bad Puns. Terrible Puns.
- Music ponderings
- [#16a2b0](https://www.google.com/search?q=%239a5b84&oq=%239a5b84&aqs=chrome..69i57.635j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and things I own that are (or around)  color said color
- ... and more!
