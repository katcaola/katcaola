## Notes:
 * For those of you really like green tea, you can add more than 2 and a quarter table spoons of the powder to the base dough.
 * Matcha powder and most of the asian treats can be found at asian super markets or sometimes Whole Foods. If you do not have asian grocery stores near you, your next best bet is probably Amazon or eBay.
 * [Matcha Oreos](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/d6/3c/a3/d63ca3de6fa0cef2e65a204f9ec00dc4.jpg){:target="_blank"} actually exist, but good luck finding them outside of Japan.
 * A lot of the matcha candy treats may have to be imported. If this does not sound good to your wallet, you can always make your own substitutions or find recipes online to make your own matcha chocolates so you don't have to buy them.
