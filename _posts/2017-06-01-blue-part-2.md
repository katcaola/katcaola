I like [this blue](https://www.google.com/search?q=%239a5b84&oq=%239a5b84&aqs=chrome..69i57.635j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=%2316a2b0){:target="_blank"}. A lot. Here is the second part of all the kitchen items I have! My partner and I have managed to collect a lot when we were introduced to the adulting world and needed to cook for ourselves. 

## Items I own:

* Silverstone Bakeware
    * [Silverstone Cookie Sheet](http://www.silverstone.com/Bakeware/SilverStone-Bakeware-10-Inch-x-15-Inch-Cookie-Pan-Blue-59165.html){:target="_blank"}
	* [Silverstone Cake Pan](http://www.silverstone.com/Bakeware/SilverStone-Bakeware-9-Inch-x-13-Inch-Covered-Cake-Pan-Blue-59169.html){:target="_blank"}
	* We liked these pans, although they have since peeled and started rusting. We mainly use them for foods (or crafts) that need to be in the oven but not in direct contact with the pan. For instance, cooking packaged frozen food for dinner or cooking painted glass to set the design.
* [Vapur Anti-bottle - 1 Liter](http://vapur.us/shop/element-water-1l?color=Water&colorswatch_capacity=1+Liter+%2834oz%29){:target="_blank"}
    * This was a godsend for me in my college marching band days. I would roll it up when it was empty and keep it in my shako. It's great for having water around and takes up very little space when empty.
* [Life Factory Glass Water Bottle](http://www.freshpreserving.com/ball-collection-elite-wide-mouth-quart-32-oz.-blue-glass-mason-jars-with-lids-and-bands-4-count-1033951VM.html){:target="_blank"}
	* Inspired by [Beth Terry's _My Plastic Free Life_](https://myplasticfreelife.com/plastic-free-how-i-kicked-the-plastic-habit-and-how-you-can-too/){:target="_blank"} I caved and got a glass water bottle. I also bought an extra cap that came with a build in silicone straw because I didn't want to have to tip the bottle to drink from it. _My inner 5-year-old also wanted something that felt like a sippy cup_
* Retro Teal and Purple Igloo Cooler
* Pyrex 100 Year Anniversary Measuring Cup
* Pyrex 100 Year Decorated Storage Container
* Pyrex Teal Squares Decorated Storage Container
* [Squish 6 Quart Plastic Expandable Colander](https://www.target.com/p/squish-6-quart-plastic-expandable-colander-blue/-/A-14406655){:target="_blank"}
