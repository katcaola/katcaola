I am fascinated by miniature things and things that are the "wrong size". Miniature (and usable) frying pans and oversized clothespins are right up my alley. I especially love _miniature cookware_ and _miniature food_. So once I became an adult, I indulged and decided that miniature things were good for me because it helped me cut down on my portion sizes. Also, mini things are just really, _really_ cute.

Thus I will introduce you to my first miniature inspired recipe: _Mini Chocolate M&M Pretzels_

Every year around the holidays, my mom would recruit my brothers and I to help her make various dessert foods for the many holiday parties that we would attend as a family. 

One of my favorites, for its ease of creation and deliciousness, were pretzels with a melted chocolate kiss and m&m on top. Usually these were topped green and red m&ms to commemorate the holiday. They looked something [like this](http://www.dessertnowdinnerlater.com/christmas-pretzel-hugs/){:target="_blank"} but had milk chocolate kisses.

## Ingredients

* About 1/4 cup of chocolate chips
* [1 cup mini pretzels](https://www.amazon.com/Summer-Harvest-Brand-Kings-Pretzels/dp/B008HQV7B0/ref=pd_sim_325_6?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B008HQV7B0&pd_rd_r=6SHNSCHZJ69S2MWK1TH3&pd_rd_w=cxq02&pd_rd_wg=8IOl7&psc=1&refRID=6SHNSCHZJ69S2MWK1TH3){:target="_blank"}

## Instructions
1. Place pretzels on a microwave safe plate. Put as many as you can fit on the plate. <figure><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/58/94/76/5894761612dd23b5ad7b684f93a9a469.png" alt="Mini pretzels on a plate"></figure>

2. Place chocolate chips on top of pretzels, flat side down. Try to place in the very center of the pretzel. <figure><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/54/98/dc/5498dc059c2efdafe4876242c478a6e7.jpg" alt="Mini Chocolate M&M Pretzels"></figure>

3. Place the plate with the pretzels topped with chocolate chips in the microwave. Microwave for 20 seconds and then again for 20 seconds. _(See notes at bottom for alternatives to microwaving)_

4. Pull the plate out carefully as it may be hot, then place on a trivet. For each pretzel, push a single mini m&m into the melted chocolate chip.<figure><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/18/89/0d/18890d4807fcf026fd4ee7697caa0738.png" alt="Mini Pretzels with Chocolate M&Ms"></figure>

5. Place in the freezer for 5-10 minutes (until the chocolate chips hardens again)

## Notes:
 * For those of you who don't like microwaves, you can also use the oven or a toaster oven (not a plain bread slot toaster though). Just be sure to use an oven safe surface (like a baking sheet) when putting pretzels into the oven.
    * _I used Whole Foods 365 brand semi-sweet chocolate chips, but any brand that you can get a hold of will do. It doesn't even have to be semi-sweet chocolate, it can be white chocolate, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, peanut butter chips or anything else that comes in a general "chocolate chip" shape._
 * The pretzels I used, I actually saved from flying. I saved all those little airline sized snack bags for a few months. You can actually buy them [online](https://www.amazon.com/Summer-Harvest-Brand-Kings-Pretzels/dp/B008HQV7B0/ref=pd_sim_325_6?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B008HQV7B0&pd_rd_r=6SHNSCHZJ69S2MWK1TH3&pd_rd_w=cxq02&pd_rd_wg=8IOl7&psc=1&refRID=6SHNSCHZJ69S2MWK1TH3){:target="_blank"}, which is a cheaper alternative to flying somewhere just to get mini pretzels. Search around to see if you can get them in larger containers instead of individually wrapped bags.
