# Blue

I like [this blue](https://www.google.com/search?q=%239a5b84&oq=%239a5b84&aqs=chrome..69i57.635j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=%2316a2b0). A lot. Lucky for me it's one of those ephemeral colors that the design deities decided was "in". Here is one of many posts showing off part of my large collection of the things I own in this blue. _(For future reference I will try to keep these posts to once a month)._

## Yes it's blue, but what _color_ is it?
 I've had a hard time trying to describe this color. Sometimes I call it teal, sometimes turquoise, and anecdotally aqua, but not aquamarine, cyan, or sky blue. It's definitely a [blue-green](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green), but `"blue-green"` makes me think of something that is more green than blue, like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=%233A6960+color&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-yaz8s-bTAhUF1oMKHUfhCKsQ_AUIBSgA&biw=1206&bih=681&dpr=1). If anyone has a solution to this conundrum, please let me know.
