I like [this blue](https://www.google.com/search?q=%239a5b84&oq=%239a5b84&aqs=chrome..69i57.635j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=%2316a2b0){:target="_blank"}. A lot. Lucky for me it's one of those ephemeral colors that the design deities decided was "in". Here is one of many posts showing off my large collection of the things I own in this blue. 

_(For future reference I will try to keep these #16a2b0 (Blue) posts to once a month)._

## Items I own:

Here is the first part of all the kitchen items I have! My partner and I have managed to collect a lot when we were introduced to the adulting world and needed to cook for ourselves. 

* Silverstone Pans
    * [Large and medium pans](http://www.silverstone.com/Cookware/SilverStone-Ceramic-CXi-Twin-Pack-9-Inch-and-11.25-Inch-Deep-Skillets-Blue-16221.html){:target="_blank"}
	* [Small pan](http://www.silverstone.com/Cookware/SilverStone-Ceramic-CXi-8-Inch-Deep-Skillet-Blue-16219.html){:target="_blank"}
	* We like these pans, although the they've stained quite a bit on the bottom and a little bit on the insides, despite the fact that they are supposed to be non-stick. They still work well and just need a little extra TLC when it comes to cleaning.
* [Teal Hobnail Teapot](http://www.teavana.com/us/en/sale/teal-hobnail-cast-iron-teapot-011056791.html){:target="_blank"}
    * I like this teapot, the downside is that the enamel around the opening began to peel. I managed to fix it myself by sanding off the loose bits of enamel and dabbing olive oil around it. I then baked it for a few hours to solidify the oil, and it was good as new. Some would argue that olive oil was not the way to go, but cast iron is cast iron, and it worked for me.
* [Kitchenaid Can Opener](https://www.amazon.com/Kitchenaid-Stainless-Steel-Opener-Deep/dp/B00IWMLKWA/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1494815685&sr=8-6&keywords=kitchenaid+can+opener){:target="_blank"}
* [Blue Mason Jar](http://www.freshpreserving.com/ball-collection-elite-wide-mouth-quart-32-oz.-blue-glass-mason-jars-with-lids-and-bands-4-count-1033951VM.html){:target="_blank"}
	* My partner and I have several of these that have popsicle sticks with chores. We have jars saying "You", "Me", "Us", "Chores", and "Done" to help denote who does what and what still needs to be done.
* Silicone oven mit
* [Core Kitchen silicone spoon rest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/92534967322483128/){:target="_blank"}
* [Core Kitchen Cookware Protector](https://www.amazon.com/Core-Kitchen-Cookware-Protector-Set/dp/B014X2S020){:target="_blank"}
* [IKEA ORDENTLIG coasters](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70295428/){:target="_blank"}

## Yes it's blue, but what _color_ is it?
 I've had a hard time trying to describe this color. Sometimes I call it teal, sometimes turquoise, and anecdotally aqua, but not aquamarine, cyan, or sky blue. It's definitely a [blue-green](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green){:target="_blank"}, but `"blue-green"` makes me think of something that is more green than blue, like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=%233A6960+color&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-yaz8s-bTAhUF1oMKHUfhCKsQ_AUIBSgA&biw=1206&bih=681&dpr=1){:target="_blank"}. If anyone has a solution to this conundrum, please let me know.
